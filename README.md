# EHR PROJECT

The ECRI_CARE health information system is a digital version of a patient's medical chart designed to improve the quality and safety of patient care by providing healthcare providers with immediate access to a patient's complete medical history.
It is designed with focus on the doctor's interface, and has proven to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing physicians to easily access and manage patient information from any location, making it easier for them to provide continuity of care. It typically includes features such as tools for ordering and viewing lab results, imaging studies, and other diagnostic tests.
